Improve the user interface:
Add clear labels for the input fields, such as "Topic", "Context", "Length", "Tone", "Language Style", 
and "Audience Type".

Use input validation to ensure that the user enters valid input, such as ensuring that the length input 
is a number, and showing an error message if an invalid input is entered.

Consider using a more visually appealing design that makes it easier for the
 user to navigate and understand the tool.

Add more customization options:
Consider adding additional input fields for customizing the prompt, 
such as "Text Type", "Genre", or "Format".

Add more features:
Add the ability to save or share the generated prompt using a built-in feature or a third-party integration.
Add an editing feature that allows the user to refine or customize the generated
 prompt using a built-in text editor or external text editor.
